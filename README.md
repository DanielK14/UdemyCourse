Here you can find my solutions to the coding exercises of the Udemy course Complete C# Masterclass.
This repo is not designed to be build and run, it serves only as documentation. I purposely decided not to refactor 
any of the solutions in order to show my growth as a programmer. 

If you have any questions for me please feel free to send me a message.
